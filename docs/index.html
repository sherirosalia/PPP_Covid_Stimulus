                        It seems that no section of the country was untouched by enterpreneurs seeking relief from the 
                        effects of the government shutdown in reaction to the Coronavirus. The release of

                         albeit under unfortunate circumstances,
                        allows an unusual glimpse into small businesses

                            <h2>Initial analysis</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of the loans was to help businesses save jobs. The potential expenditure per capita of funds for the larger
                                loan amounts came in at $2,000 and the under $150k disbursements at $8,000 per job saved. This assessment is 
                                 based on calculations infered from statements Steve Mnuchin 
                                made, namely that the sum of the loans over $150k account for 75% of the total lent and was borrowed by only 
                                13% of enterprises.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Machine learning also suggested a dependency between number of jobs "saved" and loan amounts as it gave this feature the 
                                most weight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though the largest of loans went to seemingly the largest employers, the question arises as to how effective $2000 per job would be in helping employees in comparison
                                to the smaller business loans which had a higher amount of money per person ratio.

                        retention of the greatest number of jobs. For example, the visualizations suggest that

                        employees in proportion to how much was borrowed and "Construction" looks to be the reverse.

                        <h2>Potential and limitations </h2>
                        <p>
                        The combination of geographic, demographic and loan information provides seemingly endless opportunities for deeper analysis. For example 
                        rural vs. urban job saved as a percentage of the local population. Regional differences in loan amount, bank activity and business types could 
                        project potential economic wastelands or growth spots. Additionally, 
                        how ethnic groups are integrating into the fabric of our economy could be gleaned from the data. For example, 
                        Asians borrowed almost twice as much as Hispanics while 
                        being one third the size of the Hispanic population. This may provide insight into cultural attitudes towards self employment, borrowing
                        and proclivities towards certian industries. The fact that the NAICS codes were provided for almost all of the 5 million loans might be helpful
                        to identify our most vulnerable industries and this could help to identify where to put efforts for retraining as automation progressses. It also
                        seems like the data could also be helpful to identify industries and businesseses participating in money laundering.    
                        </p>
                        <h2>Limitations of the data</h2>
                        <p> We do not know the motivations of many of the businesses or how the money was spent.  It was supposed to save jobs, 
                            but at a 1% interest rate and the prospect of forgiveness dangled as a part of the program, it is possible that 
                            a lot of this wound up in savings accounts or the stock market. In terms of whether or not the data acurately reflects 
                            the larger environment, we do not know who was unable to get the loans and who returned it. Some of the categories are 
                            to general to be helpful. For example in "Business Type", "Sole Proprietorship", "Self Employed" and "Limited Liability Corporation" 
                            could be a gig worker or an employer. As for the racial demographic information, only about 300k responded, and it is hard to say 
                            if this is a consistent sampling or not. 
                        </p>

                         <p> 
                            The aforementioned are just a few of the limitations and possibilities that this dataset holds and additionally, since
                            the Paycheck Protection Program 
                            is still evolving there may be opportunity to add to the datasets.
 
                        </p>

                        <h2>A personal note</h2>
                        <p>
                        Small business is often touted as the "back bone" of America, and yet it seems that a mandate in reaction 
                        to a virus cut business owners "off at the knees". Even though this was mostly a pipeline project for me, compassion 
                        for the extreme nature of what small business people are experiencing led me to look at not only the general trends in 
                        an attempt to understand the effects that Covid is having on our economy but I also found myself being pulled into 
                        researching individual establishments of various categories and outliers. Some of my favorite restaurants, professional organizations, 
                        colleagues and friends appear in 
                        this database, and I am grateful for the support that this program afforded them and I hope it helps independent operators 
                        survive and thrive through the challenges from the pandemic. 
                       </p>
