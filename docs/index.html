                    <p>
                        It seems that no section of the country was untouched by enterpreneurs seeking relief from the 
                        effects of the government shutdown in reaction to the Coronavirus. The release of
                        lending records from the US Treasury in conjunction with the Small Business Association,
                         albeit under unfortunate circumstances,
                        allows an unusual glimpse into small businesses
                        affected by the crisis.

                    <p>
                    Over 50 CSV files were merged using a Python programming
                    script to automate the process. Pyspark leveraged Hadoop to speed up processing 5 million loan records and 
                    application of random forest machine learning algorithm and visualizations were produced with Python Pandas.
                    The full code and explanation of how to access the data records is in the repository linked below this paragraph.

                        <h2>The data and approach</h2>
                        <p> The information came from the SBA in two formats: The largest dataset numbering 4.3 million
                            rows provided loan amount information but the borrower names were withheld.
                            Enterprise names were revealed for lending above $150k and the debt was put into categorical range 
                            such as $3 to $5 million instead of a specific tally.
                        </p>
                        <p> Lending institution, business type and geographic location were consistent throughout
                            both datasets.  Approximately 5% of the borrowers supplied gender, racial identity and military status.
                            Even though that is a small percentage relative to the rest of the information, it still provides
                            almost a half of a million responses and the hope is that it represents general trends so it is 
                            preserved as an additional  dataset.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Business type information came in the form of numerical NAICS codes which provided no context, 
                            fortunately information from US Census allowed the  
                            convert the keys into industry names and subcategories.

                        <h2>Initial analysis</h2>
                        <p>The purpose of the loans was to help businesses save jobs. The potential expenditure per capita of funds for the larger
                            loan amounts came in at $2,000 and the under $150k disbursements at $8,000 per job saved. This assessment is 
                             based on calculations infered from statements Steve Mnuchin 
                            made, namely that the sum of the loans over $150k account for 75% of the total lent and was borrowed by only 
                            13% of enterprises.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Machine learning also suggested a dependency between number of jobs "saved" and loan ammounts as it gave this feature the 
                            most weight.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though the largest of loans went to seemingly the largest employers, the question arises as to how effective $2000 per job would be in helping employees in comparison
                            to the smaller business loans which had a higher amount of money per person ratio.

                            employees in proportion to how much was borrowed and "Construction" looks to be the reverse.

                            <h2>The next step</h2>
                            <p> There is a lot here, and the number of lines of inquiry seem potentially endless. A few ideas 
                                are to obtain granularity on loan dispersement per job saved in various categories, regional lending 
                                differences such as rural
                                vs urban, differences between banks in various states.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of many candidates for deeper analysis is a racially based observation for loans under $150k 
                                is that Asians borrowed almost twice as much as Hispanics did while only
                            being one third the size of the Hispanic population. There could be any number of reasons for this but examining
                            rates of self employment, business types and/or cultural attitudes towards business investment may be illuminating. 
                            Additionally, it is 
                            possible that Asians answered the racial inquiry more often than Hispanics which would skew the results.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The above being said, the next step in the process is using SQL relational databases for ease of combining sources 
                            and to visualize the results with Tableau. The repository for these applications is linked below.
                            </p>

                            and where to focus granular analysis in order to understand more about this ongoing economic crisis at a human and macro level.
